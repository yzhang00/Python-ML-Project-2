# Python ML Project Two

## Introduction

In this project, I load various data sets into python then run different classifiers against the training and test data for each data set, drawing conclusions regarding the prediction accuracy of each classifier. More information can be found in the Project Report PDF. This project is an extension of the first Python ML Project.

## Files for Task One:

- banana_svm.py: Python code for SVM classifier on banana dataset
- twonorm_svm.py: Python code for SVM classifier on twonorm dataset
- waveform_svm.py: Python code for SVM classifier on waveform dataset

## Files for Task Two:

- banana_nn.py: Python code for Neural Networks classifier on banana dataset
- twonorm_nn.py: Python code for Neural Networks classifier on twonorm dataset
- waveform_nn.py: Python code for Neural Networks classifier on waveform dataset

## Files for Task Three:

- cluster_within_cluster_clusters.py: Python code for cluster classifiers on cluster-within-cluster dataset
- crescent_and_the_full_moon_clusters.py: Python code for cluster classifiers on crescent-and-the-moon dataset
- two_spirals_clusters.py: Python code for cluster classifiers on two-spirals dataset
- waveform_clusters.py: Python code for cluster classifiers on waveform dataset
- cluster_within_cluster_gaussian_mix.py: Python code for Gaussian Mix classifier on cluster-within-cluster dataset
- crescent_and_the_full_moon_gaussian_mix.py: Python code for Gaussian Mix classifier on crescent-and-the-moon dataset
- two_spirals_gaussian_mix.py: Python code for Gaussian Mix classifier on two-spirals dataset

## How To Run Code:

1. Follow instructions on this website to set up proper Python ML environment and dependencies.
   (https://machinelearningmastery.com/setup-python-environment-machine-learning-deep-learning-anaconda/)
2. Open up terminal and run "python3 filename.py" and it should display all the desired output.
3. NOTE: if the code doesn't run due to invalid import statements, check which virtual environment you're on.
   Also, try using a separate terminal window instead of VSCode/PyCharm integrated terminal.
